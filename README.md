challenge-2 Stock Market Analysis Using VBA scripting in Excel

-This VBA script loop through multiple worksheet pages of Stock Market data and outputs information as directed.


-I used made up place holder data in the Quarterly_Change and Percent_Change columns to test my code. I was unable to finish the loop code to generate those columns, but wanted to complete the Conditional Formatting portion of the assignment.


-I recieved help from my tutor and referenced the Xpert Learning Assistant in BCS, as well as stack overflow in order to complete some of the code.
